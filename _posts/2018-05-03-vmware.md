How do you find the disks you want to install on - we've all seen the generic scripts, like this:

~~~
accepteula
install --firstdisk --overwritevmfs
rootpw vmware123
reboot
~~~

But what if you want to install ESXi on a specific drive? And then format another drive? Looking through the command reference found [here](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2004582) we can see that we can use the following commands with arguments to be more specific:

~~~
install --firstdisk=argument1,argument2,argument3 --novmfsondisk --overwritevmfs
partition datastore1 --onfirstdisk=argument1,argument2,argument3
~~~

The arguments in this case refers to the 3 differents options you can chose from, namely:

- Local - install on first LOCAL disk
- Remote - install on first REMOTE disk (FC or iSCi LUN disk)
- USB - install on a device that uses this driver in the vmkernel (might be the case for SD-cards)

Now, let's construct our base script. We want to install ESXi on a SD-card and then put our datastore on our raid. How would we do this, reliably? First we need to find the names of the disks (either in BIOS/UEFI( or by using these commands:

~~~
esxcli storage core adapter list
esxcli storage core device list
esxcli storage nmp device list
~~~

Now we should have a list of adapters and disks - but what parameters to use. Please keep in mind that SAS-disks might register as remote disks, for some reason. [Don't ask.](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1027819)
An example might be this:

~~~
clearpart --alldrives --overwritevmfs
install --firstdisk=ata --novmfsondisk --overwritevmfs
partition datastore1 --onfirstdisk=sas,local
~~~

This script should, if the parameters for the disks are right, clear all drives (even if vmfs exists), then install on the first ata-disk it finds, also overwriting existing config. Then finally it partitions a datastore on the first sas-disk it finds, which should be a virtual drive for our raid.

Hope this helps.
