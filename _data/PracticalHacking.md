Using HackTheBox.eu - a fantastic platform for boot2root and other types of challenges, you can learn tools, tricks and meet people working to improve their technical skills. It's a great stepping stone for something like Offensive Security's Certified Penetration-tester (OSCP).

## The GitBook itself splits into 4 different chapters or parts if you'd like

### Part 1 - How to hack

A methodical approach to hacking invidiual boxes, mostly by using automatic tools.

### Part 2 - Hacking manually

Taking the step beyond automatic tools to get an understanding of what hacking really is.

### Part 3 - Web hacking

Introduction to the vast world of of web hacking.

### Part 4 - Privilege escalation

Goes deeper into the subject of escalating privileges.
