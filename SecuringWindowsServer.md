# Securing Windows Server 2016

## About the guide

### Chapter 1 - Server Hardening

[Part 2 - Implement server patching, updating solutions and malware protection](https://www.infernux.no/2018-10-28-securingwindowsserver12/)

[Part 3 - Protect credentials and create security baselines](https://www.infernux.no/SecuringWindowsServer/)
