# Securing Windows Server 2016

## About the guide

In this "guide" I'll write about the things I summarized for myself while taking the exam, going into some of the concepts, technologies and PowerShell cmdlets I studied and used.

### Chapter 1 - Server Hardening

A server is a soft-target if operating system files installed from non trusted source, system is not current with system and security patches, administrators have weak passwords or if file systems don't use NTFS and are unencrypted. Chapter 1 will look at implementing solutions to deal with this.

[Part 2 - Implement server patching, updating solutions and malware protection](https://www.infernux.no/2018-10-28-securingwindowsserver12/)

[Part 3 - Protect credentials and create security baselines](https://www.infernux.no/2018-11-01-securingwindowsserver13/)

### Chapter 2 - Secure a Virtualization Infrastructure

Here we take a look at implementing a Guarded Fabric solution, complete with HGS, shielded VMs and the likes.
