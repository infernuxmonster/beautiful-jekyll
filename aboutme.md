### About me

Hey, I'm Truls Dahlsveen, also known as *infernux*.

I'm currently working as a infrastructure and security consultant.
I've previously worked on support, network administration, system administration and a bunch of other stuff.

On this page I'm writing about mostly PowerShell, Windows Server and security.
