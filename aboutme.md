### About me

Hey, I'm Truls Dahlsveen, also known as online as *infernux*.

<script src="https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/13543"></script>

I'm currently working as an infrastructure and security consultant.
I've previously worked on IT support, network and system administration.

On this page I'm writing about mostly PowerShell, Windows Server and security - stuff I'm currently learning myself, so if something is wrong (there will be loads), please hit me up and I'll correct it!
