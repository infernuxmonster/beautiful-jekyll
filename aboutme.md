### About me.

I'm Truls, I'm 20ish something soon to be 30. I'm a systems and network-administrator turned developer and pentester.
I spend my spare time running and playing games.

### Technologies.

I dabble in most of everything, as long as I find it interesting.

### What's the webpage for?

Honestly, no idea. Figured if I have something cool to post I'll do it here.

### Working on anything special?

Looking into OSCP for now, but that's a mostly 2019 goal.

### I want to start working in security, where do I begin?

*Honestly I'd recommend learning a lot about everything, but in due time. Start small.
*I'd say start off doing networking or as a sysadmin - you'll learn so much about how companies do stuff, how users fuck stuff up and how you can abuse that. 
*Same goes for network-admin.

*Take notes! Everything you do might help you someday, the world of security is expansive.
