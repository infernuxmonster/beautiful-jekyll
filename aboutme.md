## $whoami

### Hi, I'm Truls

I'm an IT Consultant. At the moment I work mostly with infrastructure, automation and security.

This website is just my notes from when I'm taking certifications, building stuff in my lab or hacking on HackTheBox.eu.
Hopefuly some of it is of use to anyone.

Feedback always welcome.
