### About me.

Just a hacker.

### I want to start working in security, where do I begin?

* Honestly I'd recommend learning a lot about everything, but in due time. Start small, focus on one thing.
* Start off doing networking or as a sysadmin - you'll learn so much about how companies do stuff, how users fuck stuff up and how you can abuse that. 
* [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu "This is really cool")
* Take notes! Everything you do might help you someday, the world of security is expansive.
