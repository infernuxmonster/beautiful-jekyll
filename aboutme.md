### About me.

I'm a 20ish something soon to be 30. I'm a systems and network-administrator turned developer and pentester.
I spend my spare time running and playing games.

### What's the webpage for?

Honestly, no idea. Figured if I have something cool to post I'll do it here.

### Working on anything special?

Nope.

### I want to start working in security, where do I begin?

* Honestly I'd recommend learning a lot about everything, but in due time. Start small, focus on one thing.
* Start off doing networking or as a sysadmin - you'll learn so much about how companies do stuff, how users fuck stuff up and how you can abuse that. 
* [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu "This is really cool")
* Take notes! Everything you do might help you someday, the world of security is expansive.
